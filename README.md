# P1-Medium-blog

This project is part of the DataScience Nanodegree from udacity
The idea is the to analyze data and write a blog about it

------------------------------------------

This project analyses the Seattle Airbnb dataset from kaggle with 3 main question:
1- What is the percentage of occupied rooms?
2- How do the Prices of rooms change across the year?
3- What is the cheapest neighborhood to rent a room?

------------------------------------------

You need to install Pandas, Numpy, and Plotly libraries in order to run the code.
The repository contains a jupyter notebook, and a folder contains the data I worked with.
